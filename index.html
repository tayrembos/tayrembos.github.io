              Engineering Manager at Arthrex</h2>
            <p>"We hired Taylor as an intern ... to help with a database cleansing project. She did an excellent job working with all the stakeholders listening and understanding requirements while designing meaningful solutions. She utilized her Visual Basic and SQL coding skills to develop and implement custom scripts to automate much of our effort. <p>In doing so, Taylor demonstrated a high degree of personal initiative and ability to research and solve technical hurdles on her own. We have greatly benefitted from her efforts. I can confidently recommend Taylor to be a high performing individual. She will be a core asset on any team fortunate to have her as a member."

            <p>"Over this year I have come to recognize Taylor for her work ethic, caring nature, and dedication...She creatively looks at situations and information shared to reach an informed and rationale decision. She is not always the first one to speak but when she does speak she has substance to what she is saying.
            <p>
            She works well within a group setting. Couple these skills that Taylor has with the inherent skills that come along with serving as a [Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution Committee Member] member, and you have yourself a wonderful employee.
            <p>
            Taylor is the type of individual that I would love to hire and someone I think can be successful no matter the environment she is put in... She has a very upbeat and “can-do” attitude that is infectious. She cares about others and will do what she can or say what is appropriate to try and help someone or brighten up their day. How amazing would it be if everyone on a team cared enough about the other members of the team to help them be successful? She is the type of employee that I think would be an asset to the organization.

            <p>To whom it may Concern,
              <p> Please allow this letter to serve as an enthusiastic recommendation for Taylor Rembos... Taylor brought with her strong technical skills, an engaging personality and an exceptional work ethic. All this while maintaining a challenging senior year curriculum together with a demanding extra curricular schedule.
              <p> I found her to be a quick study with very good people skills, essential and necessary skills sets in our line of work.
              <p> I would welcome further inquiries.
              <p> Sincerely, <br> Richard A. Botthof
